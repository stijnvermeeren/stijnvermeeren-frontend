  <h2>How to pronounce my name</h2>

  <h3>Stijn</h3>

  <p>People who don't speak Dutch commit all kinds of blasphemies when they attempt to pronounce my name. They promote the <em>jn</em> of <em>Stijn</em> into a separate syllable to make it sound like <em>Sti-dzjen</em> (wrong!). Or they try to say the German word <em>stein</em> with a German <em>ei</em>-sound and a <em>sh</em>abby, <em>sh</em>ocking and <em>sh</em>ameful <em>sh</em> in the beginning; quelle horreur!</p>

  <p>Although the Dutch <em>ij</em>-sound is related to the German <em>ei</em>, it is certainly not pronounced in the same way. In Norwegian the <em>ei</em>-sound is much closer to the Dutch <em>ij</em>. In fact, the Norwegian word <em>stein</em> (meaning <em>stone</em>) would be an acceptable pronunciation of my first name. But this is unlikely to help most people...</p>

  <p>In fact, there is no unique correct way of pronouncing the <em>ij</em>. In Flanders, where I am from, is resembles the <em>ai</em> in the French word <em>maison</em>, so my name sounds a bit like the English name <em>Stan</em> but with a longer vowel. In the Netherlands it is much more a of dipthong. Either way, people get horribly misguided. If I introduce myself with a Flemish pronunciation, they think I'm called <em>Stan</em> which is a completely different name. If I try a Dutch accent, they get the horrid idea that my name is <em>stain</em> as in "the red wine left a nasty stain on your shirt". There's a significant difference in the pronunciation; <em>stain</em> contains an [e]-sound (which the French would write as <em>é</em>), whereas my name rather has an [ɛ]-sound (which the French would write as <em>è</em>); but this goes unnoticed every single time.</p>

  <p>If you are an English speaker, I suggest the following trick to get my first name right: repeatedly say English verb <em>stayin'</em> (as in the Bee Gees song), and gradually morph towards the English name <em>Stan</em>. About <strong>halfway between <em>stayin'</em> and <em>Stan</em></strong> is a perfect pronunciation of <em>Stijn</em>.</p>

  <p>The name <em>Stijn</em> doesn't really have a meaning. Apparently, it is a shortened form of <em>Augustine</em> or <em>Constantine</em>. It's a relatively common name in Flanders and the Netherlands. In 2013, there were 13275 persons named Stijn in Flanders, making my name the 36st most common (77th in the whole of Belgium) [<nuxt-link to="http://statbel.fgov.be/nl/modules/publications/statistiques/bevolking/prenoms_de_la_population_totale.jsp">source</nuxt-link>]. In the Netherlands, the name <em>Stijn</em> is 51st most common among children born between 1983 and 2006 [<nuxt-link to="http://www.naamkunde.net/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=135&Itemid=69">source</nuxt-link>].</p>

  <h3>Vermeeren</h3>

  <p>It doesn't get easier when you try my family name <em>Vermeeren</em>. The different ways of pronouncing the vowel <em>e</em> in Dutch are often a source of confusion - if not madness - to foreign learners. The <em>e</em> is pronounced sometimes as a long French <em>é</em> (such as in the English verb <em>s<strong>a</strong>y</em> when you say it slowly), sometimes as the French <em>è</em> (such as in the English word <em>b<strong>e</strong>d</em>), or otherwise as a schwa (such as in <em>heav<strong>e</strong>n</em>).</p>

  <p>To confuse you a little more, let me add that if my last name were a normal Dutch word, pronounced in exactly the same way, it would be spelled <em>vermeren</em> with one <em>e</em> in the middle. However, the archaic spelling of my family name might actually help you to remember the correct pronunciation.</p>

  <p>Indeed, both single <em>e</em>'s are pronouned as schwas, and the double <em>e</em> in the middle is like a long French <em>é</em>. Put together, it sounds approximately like <em><strong>vr-ma</strong>[y]<strong>-run</strong></em>, with the <em>y</em>-sound of <em>may</em> omitted and with the stress on the middle syllable.</p>

  <p><em>Meeren</em> means <em>lakes</em> (the modern spelling is <em>meren</em>). <em>Ver</em> is derived from <em>van der</em> which means <em>from the</em>. It is common for a Dutch family name to start with <em>Ver</em>, but the name <em>Vermeeren</em> is quite rare. In 2008 there where 805 Vermeerens in Belgium [<nuxt-link to="https://www.familienaam.be/Vermeeren">source</nuxt-link>]. Additionally, there were 1338 Vermeerens living in the Netherlands in 2007 [<nuxt-link to="http://www.meertens.knaw.nl/nfb/detail_naam.php?gba_lcnaam=vermeeren&gba_naam=Vermeeren&nfd_naam=Vermeeren&operator=eq&taal=">source</nuxt-link>]. Most of them live in the area around Antwerp (in the North of Belgium) and Breda (in the South of the Netherlands). Indeed, my father grew up in Meerle, between Antwerp and Breda. However, in my hometown Aarschot, more central in Belgium, my family is the only one named <em>Vermeeren</em>.</p>

  <p>There are also a few surnames that are closely related to <em>Vermeeren</em>. <em>Vermeersch</em> is quite common in West-Flanders. <em>Vermeiren</em> is a common name around Antwerp. <em>Vermeire</em> is common around Ghent and <em>Vermeir</em> is common near Dendermonde. In the Netherlands there are also about 3000 people named <em>Vermeer</em>, like the famous 17th century painter. You might also come across <em>Vermeren</em>, with a single <em>e</em> in the middle, but this is even more rare than <em>Vermeeren</em>.</p>
